    Special tips:

    <p>Having the passion for your career is one step, honing it like a hidden treasure helps you stand in the better position for your short coming of your goal. <br> More than that, take to yourself as discipline better than motivation do all you can without
        weakness and feel that you are a leader and you can make a change in society and the survivor of the society is your responsibility. Read more about<a href="https://www.younglife.org/en/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"> Young Life</a> leader
        for more inspirations.</p>

    <p>Life is always full of challenges and disappointments. But I have a good news for you, which is, they are meant to make you strong. You don't need to quit or consult oracle for your success. All you need to do is trust God and put your all into to
        your interest. Because things don't just happened. <br> These wise sayings is real "pain no gain" and "success will only come after hard work". Learn to follow instructions and obey commandments even though things get difficult, but adjust yourself
        to it, for you will experience a better achievement. Note: Where your obedient stops, there where your blessing stops. <br>
